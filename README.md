Backend for a shelved price comparison app

I planned "Firstprice" to be an app which serves as a price comparison tool for retail shoppers in the UAE, similar to the Pricena concept. While building out the app backend was successful, I chose not to proceed with the frontend because of the poor viability of the idea, notably the lack of accuracy in the major retailers due to third-party listings, as well as differences between in-store and online prices. Selenium was used to extract and parse data from the major retailers, and the results are currently stored in Google Sheets. The setup file for linking the Python code with Google Sheets is not included.
